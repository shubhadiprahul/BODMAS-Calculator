# BODMAS-Calculator

## BODMAS
BODMAS stands for Bracket, Of, Division, Multiplication, Addition, and Subtraction. The BODMAS is used to explain the order of operation of a mathematical expression.

## What I Did?
This is a simple bodmas calulator using python. I tried not to use any inbuilt functions like eval or anyhting. I used the basic concepts of python.

## How to Run
Just install python on your terminal in ubuntu and with the command `python3 bodmas_calc.py` you will be asked to enter expression to solve as input. Just give any input. :-)
